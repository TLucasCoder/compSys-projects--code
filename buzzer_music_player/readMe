This Challenge uses the buzzer to play a sequence of notes as a song. 

For the nodes, we have specified different tunes corresponds to different refreqencies for the buzzer to play the correct note.
In the array of notes, we've use a pattern of [note, speed, note, speed ...] where the speed specifies how long will the note be played, as a divisor to divide a whole note. 
    For example, for speed = 4, the duration will be 1/4 times of the whole note, which have been default as 2 seconds

The button on the maker pico can also be used to control what song it is going to play, controlling up to 3 songs by GPIO pin 20,21, and 22.

Way to run the file: preferably use Thonny to run it on pi pico, just click the run button while having the pico plugged in.
The firmware of micropython have to be installed into the pico before using it.
version used: pimoroni-picow-v1.21.0-micropython.uf2
