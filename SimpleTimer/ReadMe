This challenge is a simple Timer made on maker pico.

The two buttons, with GPIO Pin 20 as the reduce button, and GPIO Pin 21 as the increase button, are used to control the time of the 
timer. The time set is indicated by the number of illuminated LED light from PIN 1 to PIN 15, each represents 1 second by default.

After using the two buttons to adjust the desire time length for the timer, we can then use the further right button using GPIO Pin 22, 
to start the timer. The LED lights will gaudrally switched off when the time passes. When it reaches zero, the buzzer will be triggered and 
the LED lights will Fade in and out, signifying the end of count down. 

To reset the timer, simply press the RUN button to reset it.
