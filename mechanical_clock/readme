This project used micropython to create a mechanical-style clock on the pico LCD 1.3" display.

The major functionalities consist of: 
    a clock with needles pointing at the current hour, minute, and second; 
    a display of the current date; and
    the current temperature recorded by the pi pico's temperature module.
All of the three elements can be used by pressing the button below the LCD display.
    Button Y for the main clock,
    Button X for the current temperature,
    Button B for the date in the format : dd/mm/yyyy
The clock also have the date installed on the clockface to simulate a real look of a watch.

The program also rely on a segment of code obtained from the documentation of pico-lcd 1.3" as the driver to initialise the display.

Way to run the file: preferably use Thonny to run it on pi pico, just click the run button while having the pico plugged in.
The firmware of micropython have to be installed into the pico before using it.
version used: pimoroni-picow-v1.21.0-micropython.uf2
