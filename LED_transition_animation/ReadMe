In this project we have created 3 different types of LED animation modes, which can be accessed by pressing the buttons on the maker pi pico board to activate the modes.

The first button is the one lighting up all the LEDs one by one from Pin 0 to the end, then switching off them one by one again from pin 0 to the end.

The second button is the one showing transition of LEDs lighting up alternatively.

The third one is the one the transition showing the illuiminated light traversing from the end to Pin 0, then stacking up until all the LEDs are lit.

Pressing the button during the transition will cause it instant stop and switch to the other one corresponds to the button clicked.
